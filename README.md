# Why? 

here is a link I received from the software craftsman of lille.  One gift, a wonderful advent calendar to wait until 
Christmas.  One coding puzzle every day.
For my side, I decided to solve it with a different language each day (if I succeed), by this way I hope train and grow up my capabilites and discover new technologies, new ways of coding.
